## 0:00 - 0:30 | Introduction
"Hello everyone. Today, I’m excited to introduce **Red Pocket**, a project that transforms crypto asset transfers from cold financial transactions into a social, engaging, and fun experience.

In the blockchain world, payments are often technical and impersonal—just numbers moving from one address to another. We wanted to change that completely by adding 'soul' to the experience."

---

## 0:30 - 1:00 | Inspiration & Vision (The "Why")
"When developing Red Pocket, we drew heavy inspiration from the deeply rooted **Chinese tradition of 'Hongbao'** (Red Envelopes) and its massive digital success in super-apps like **WeChat**. In Asia, billions of people send these 'Lucky Red Envelopes' to each other on special occasions or just for fun, creating waves of excitement within social groups.

We have rebuilt this phenomenon on the **Tempo** network, but with a fully decentralized and transparent architecture."

## 1:00 - 1:40 | How It Works & Features
"With Red Pocket, you can now gift crypto to your friend group, community, or employees in seconds. We offer two core modes:

1.  **Equal Mode:** A fair method where everyone gets an equal share.
2.  **Lucky Mode:** This is the most exciting part! You set a total amount, and our smart contract distributes it **randomly**. Who gets how much is entirely up to chance, turning the process into a thrilling game.

All you need to do is create a 'Red Pocket' and drop the generated link into your WhatsApp, Telegram, or Discord group."

## 1:40 - 2:00 | Technology & Architecture
"Behind the scenes, we leveraged **Privy** technology to remove crypto barriers. This means even users without a wallet can simply log in with their Google account and claim their gifts instantly.

Red Pocket merges traditional gifting culture with the power of blockchain.

Thank you for listening!"
